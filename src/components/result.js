      <p>
        Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability that can
        cause significant social, communication, and behavioral challenges. People
        with ASD may experience difficulty with social interaction, repetitive
        behaviors, speech and nonverbal communication, and sensory sensitivities.
      </p>
      <h2>Next Steps</h2>
      <p>
        If you are concerned that you or your child may have ASD, please seek
        professional help. Early intervention is important for improving
        outcomes for people with ASD. You can start by talking to your doctor or
        pediatrician about your concerns.
